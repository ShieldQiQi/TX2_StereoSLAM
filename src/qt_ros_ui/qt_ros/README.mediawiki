= Qt-Ros =

Ros Documentation and Tutorials: http://wiki.ros.org/qt_create

=== Overview ===

Includes templates and create scripts for quickly developing qt-based ros packages.

* catkin_create_qt_pkg for quickly templating a qt-ros package.
* Includes a master chooser as a docking element.

=== Status ===

This package is and has been in maintenance mode for quite some time. Feel free to fork it and iterate on it if it serves a useful purpose for you.

=== Future Work Ideas ===

* Check if we still need cmake support for mingw's static builds.
* Support more templates.
* Spin off into a separate python module.
* QDesigner elements.
